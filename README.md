# 😊 Face Emotional Data Detection  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project focuses on detecting facial emotions using deep learning and computer vision techniques. The model is trained on facial images and classifies emotions such as **happy, sad, angry, surprised**, etc.  

## 🔥 Features  
- **Real-time emotion detection** using OpenCV.  
- **Deep learning-based model** built with TensorFlow & Keras.  
- **Preprocessing and augmentation** using Keras Preprocessing.  
- **Dataset handling** with Pandas & NumPy.  
- **Interactive Jupyter Notebook** for training the model.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Deep Learning:** TensorFlow, Keras  
- **Data Handling:** Pandas, NumPy  
- **Computer Vision:** OpenCV  
- **Visualization & Utilities:** Matplotlib, tqdm, Pillow  
- **Machine Learning:** Scikit-Learn

## 📊 Dataset  
- Ensure you have a labeled dataset with facial images categorized into different emotions.  
- Dataset preprocessing includes resizing, normalization, and augmentation.  

## 🛠 Future Enhancements  
- Implement real-time emotion detection in a webcam-based application.  
- Optimize model performance with transfer learning.  
- Deploy as a web-based app using Flask or FastAPI.
